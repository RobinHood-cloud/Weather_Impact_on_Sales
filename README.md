Project Overview

This project explores how weather conditions influence coffee shop sales, providing valuable insights to optimize inventory management, staffing decisions, and marketing strategies. By analyzing historical sales and weather data, we uncover trends that impact consumer purchasing behavior.

Key Insights

- Peak Sales Hours: 10 AM - 8 PM, with the highest spike at 10 AM.
- Top-Selling Drinks: Latte and Americano with milk, accounting for 48% of total sales.
- Weather Influence:
  - Sales peak on rainy and partially cloudy days.
  - Sales decline significantly during hot weather.
  - The optimal sales temperature range is 5°C - 20°C.

Data Sources

- Sales Data: Extracted from the coffee shop's EPOS system (March - December 2024).
- Weather Data: Collected from [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/), a reliable weather data provider.
